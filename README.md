##### EXAMPLE
python main.py (defaults to 8, 12)
python main.py --range 20 (would be 20, 23)
python main.py --range <YOUR-CHOICE-OF-INT>

sleep_clock is random to not give too much uniformity in regards to the situation. A simple but possibly "good enough" trick



this is quick and dirty, coded up whilst waiting for afk tasks to finish, to work for certain afk scenarios (for my own needs) without wasting too much time implementing cv and ai methods. Code on your other screen whilst ranking up in your favorite mmorpgs.


**HOW WOULD YOU DO THIS IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE IT SERIOUS FROM EXTERNAL SCRIPTS NOT TOUCHING GAME CODE**

- depending on sitatuion, possibnly triggered by enum or localized ai vision itself, you can begin to use function mapping to push into what needs to happen depending on the certain situation. Motherlode mine could be a place where you do such a thing. With stars you simply could openCV difference between pixels then find the pattern that matches (stars) which should be unique enough to then click on each time it changes on a certain chunck. This would erxternally say som,ething has changed adn to randomrange a 1,3 to emulate latency of brain to then start mingin again. 

You would subscribe to change rat her than hit on loops. The issue with clicking is you, for one, look like a bot, and for two, you could get out of sync with the frrquency of spawns in regards to modulus and lose out on precious AFK mining time. "kinf of how primes and bugs in nature enable certain predators to not hit. This would make you the big stupid predator using timers not subscribing to change. yes, everything is essentialy loops, but let's say loops on different timers for precision if we get bare bones.
